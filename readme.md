== RtMidi - D port ==

This is a D port for the realtime MIDI i/o C++ RtMidi library, version 2.0.1. 

Using a callback function is not supported. 

recarder.d is a fairly complete example of how to use it (to be used with Makefile).

It has been tested on an Ubuntu Linux 12.04, however there is no OS specific code, 
so it should be portable.
